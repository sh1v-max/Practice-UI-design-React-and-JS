# Practice-UI-design-React-and-JS

This folder contains simple React problems to build efficiency in writing clean and functional components.

The goal is to improve speed, logic clarity, and confidence for machine coding rounds and frontend interviews.


### Focus 

- Functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Event handling and controlled inputs
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering and dynamic updates
- Common UI logic (e.g. todo list, toggle, counters)

Each problem is kept small and direct ‚Äî no unnecessary styling, just pure logic and component structure.
